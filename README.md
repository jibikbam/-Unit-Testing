# Unit-Testing
Sample unit testing code for C++ (cpp)

This is a small part of a project that I worked on. The purpose is to demonstrate how unit testing can be written, not to provide a runnable code.

* Testing code directory: test/
* Header directory: tools/include/
* Source directory: tools/src/
